# Module 11: Supervised learning

We introduce, from an applied perspective, machine learning theory and methods. We explore a class of algorithms known as supervised learning classifiers, including logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, perceptrons, and naive Bayes.
