# Assignment 2: Descriptive analysis

See syllabus for due date.

You will clean, organize, describe, and visualize the data you downloaded in Assignment 1.

Create a new Jupyter notebook. The first cell of your notebook should be markdown explaining what your research question and hypotheses are, where you found your data set, and what it contains. Given your proposed project:

  1. Load your data set and clean/process it as needed.
  1. Identify at least two variables of interest and calculate relevant descriptive statistics.
  1. Using the techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data set. Create at least 4 visualizations using at least 3 different visualization types (e.g., scatterplots, barplots, maps, etc).

Make sure your code is well-commented throughout for explanatory clarity. Your notebook should be well-organized into high-level sections using markdown headers representing the steps above, plus subheaders as needed. Each visualization should be followed by a markdown cell that explains what you are visualizing, why it is interesting, and why you made your specific graphical design decisions. What story does each visual tell? How does it enrich, confirm, or contradict the descriptive statistics you calculated earlier?

Your notebook should conclude with a markdown cell that interprets your descriptive statistics and visualizations in the context of your research question and what evidence they provide for your hypotheses. What are the next steps for your project, given the evidence you have presented here?

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors (i.e., restart the kernel and run all cells) and that all the visuals can be seen inline without me having to re-run your notebook. Via Blackboard, submit your notebook and data files, all zipped as a single file, named `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.zip`. If your submission file exceeds Blackboard's maximum upload size limit, you may provide a Google Drive link to your zipped data in the comment field when you submit.
