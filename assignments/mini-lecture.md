# Mini-lecture

See syllabus for dates and see Blackboard announcement.

In this assignment you will practice learning and applying a new method on your own, and then demonstrating it to others. Teaching someone else how to do something you've learned is a key skill in data analytics in both research and practice. You will create an 8-10 minute mini-lecture notebook demonstrating a method during modules 11 or 13. An example of a "method" would be random forest or k-means.

This exercise is intended to be informal and an opportunity for self-discovery. Go find something interesting, play around with it, and show us all what you figured out! The goal is to have you demonstrate your ability to teach yourself a technique prior to me demonstrating it to you.

Instructions:

  - Pick a method listed in the syllabus for those weeks or covered in the reading material.
  - Learn how the method works by reading the week's reading material.
  - Practice the method in your own notebook on your own data.
  - Google for additional usage examples and further information.
  - Prepare a mini-lecture notebook that would take 8-10 minute to present that 1) briefly introduces why someone would use the method and how it works (~2 minutes), 2) demonstrates in code how to use the method for a simple data analysis (~5 minutes), 3) summarizes what the analysis revealed (~2 minutes).

8 minutes is not a lot of time, so keep your lecture notebook simple and brief. Have a clean dataset ready to go at the beginning of your lecture. Do not show us a lot of preparatory steps setting things up in your  notebook. Jump right into the analysis that demonstrates your method.

You will be graded according to the following. In your notebook, did you:

  - summarize why someone would use this method and how it works, at a high-level
  - demonstrate the method with a simple data analysis
  - summarize what your analysis revealed
  - keep it all succinct

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors (i.e., restart the kernel and run all cells) and that all the output can be seen inline without me having to re-run your notebook. Via Blackboard, submit your notebook and data files, all zipped as a single file, named `LastName_FirstName_Lecture.zip`. If your submission file exceeds Blackboard's maximum upload size limit, you may provide a Google Drive link to your zipped data in the comment field when you submit.

Note that if you pick a supervised learning method, your assignment is due prior to class in module 11. If you pick an unsupervised learning method, your assignment is due prior to class in module 13. The "presentation" is pretend: you are just creating the lecture notebook you would have presented, and submitting it via Blackboard *before that module's class session* begins.
