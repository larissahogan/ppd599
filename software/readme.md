# Course software

You need a laptop for this course, but all the required software is free and open-source.


## Get to know your terminal

Your computer comes with a "terminal" app that lets you type commands for your computer to run (on Windows, the terminal is called "command prompt"). Before you complete the initial software setup below, make sure you have read Module 1's assigned readings on how to use the terminal.


## Initial software setup

At the beginning of the semester, you need to do a one-time setup process to install and configure the course software on your computer. The two important pieces of software that you need to install are Conda and Git. Conda is a package manager we will use to set up your Python environment. Git is a tool that lets you pull in the latest versions of the course files each week.

Install and configure the software by following the steps below.


### Step 1: Git

Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then, on your computer, open a terminal window, change directories to your desktop, and clone the course repo to your desktop by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/gboeing/ppd599.git
```

You now have a `ppd599` folder on your desktop containing the course repo.


### Step 2: Conda

Download and install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Then open a terminal window (or Anaconda command prompt if on Windows), change directories to the `ppd599` folder on your desktop, and run the following commands, one at a time:

```
conda config --prepend channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda env create --file environment.yml --force
conda activate ppd599
python -m ipykernel install --sys-prefix --name ppd599 --display-name "Python (ppd599)"
```

You now have a conda environment with all the packages needed for this course, and a Jupyter kernel installed in the environment.


## How to run Jupyter

First make sure you've completed the "initial software setup" instructions above.

When you come into class each day, before the lecture begins, do the following steps (takes <1 minute):

  1. Make sure you have the latest data from the course's Google Drive data folder
  1. Open a terminal, change directories to the `ppd599` folder on your desktop that you created in the initial software setup
  1. Run `git pull` to bring your local clone of the course repo up to date with the remote
  1. Run `conda activate ppd599` then `jupyter lab` to start your Jupyter server
  1. In your web browser, visit http://localhost:8888

When you're all done using Jupyter at the end of a session, in the menu click File > Shut Down. Do not just close your browser tab or terminal window without stopping Jupyter first. Note that you can only type commands into a terminal window when its cursor is blinking. Otherwise it's busy.


## Troubleshooting

If you run into software problems down the road, close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again. If the problem persists, uninstall Conda, uninstall Git, restart your computer, then re-do the "initial software setup" instructions above. For further troubleshooting, Google and StackOverflow are your friends!
