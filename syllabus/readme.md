# Course Description

This course provides you with a modern toolkit and skills for analyzing urban data. It will teach Python, spatial analysis, network analysis, spatial models, and introductory applied machine learning. The course takes a computational social science approach to working with data. It uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to cover coding and statistical methods that students can reproduce and experiment with in real-time in the classroom.

Students will be expected to:

  - Complete and be prepared to discuss all assigned readings
  - Attend the lecture
  - Complete and submit assignments
  - Present a mini-lecture on an applied method
  - Prepare a short conference paper and presentation

The course has prerequisites: students are expected to have taken PPD534 or an equivalent introductory course on basic Python, stats, and spatial concepts. These prerequisites will not be covered from the ground-up as you are expected to be already familiar with them. This course requires patience and practice: learning to code will take lots of trial-and-error, self-direction, repetition, and experimentation on your part. You will get out of it what you are willing to put into it. Please note that this syllabus is a living document and may be updated by the instructor during the semester as needed.




# Learning Objectives

  - Understand the nature and applications of urban analytics and urban science
  - Write code to collect, organize, analyze, and visualize urban data
  - Model and analyze urban networks
  - Train and interpret urban models




# Questions and Assistance

I am available if you need help throughout the semester and am happy to answer your questions. By email, you should expect a reply typically within approximately one working day. Office hours info is provided at the beginning of the syllabus.

Given the nature of this course, I do expect a few things of you before you seek assistance with coding/data questions:

  1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
  2. Search Google and StackOverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you're struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
  3. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
  4. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights

If the above steps haven't solved your problem, post on Slack (or attend office hours) and include the following information:

  1. A detailed description of what you're trying to do, why, and how
  2. A complete [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your code so far (never send screenshots of code/tracebacks)
  3. What you've already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it so far (specifically, explain the results of steps 1-4 above, including relevant links from StackOverflow etc)

I do not ask for this to be pedantic. Rather, I need it to be able to help you solve your problem.




# Materials

Coursework will be based on free open-source software. You will need a laptop (non-Chromebook) to install and run the course software.

Copyrighted course reading materials are available via Blackboard for enrolled students to download. The course lectures assume that you have read the assigned readings prior to the class session and are now reasonably fluent in their contents and ready to discuss/debate them in class.




# Assignments and Evaluation

Per USC guidelines, for each course unit the university expects 2 hours of out-of-class student work per week. This is a 4 unit course. Therefore, you should expect an average of 8 hours of out-of-class work each week: please budget your time accordingly. See the schedule below for assignment due dates and see the "assignments" folder for instructions. Active participation is expected (and graded) in the classroom.

Final grades will be assigned according to the following, for a total of 1000 points:

  - 500 points: 4 analytics assignments Ã— 125 points each
  - 100 points: mini-lecture
  - 100 points: final presentation
  - 200 points: final project
  - 100 points: active participation in classroom and on Slack

Assignments must be submitted via Blackboard by 23:59 pacific time on their due date. Late assignment submissions will be deducted 20% per day. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded. If you have any technical issues when submitting, contact USC IT. It is your responsibility to ensure that all submissions have gone through, so please visually confirm successful submission in the system. You can expect grades to be posted within two weeks.

# Academic Conduct and Support

## Accommodations and Extensions

Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability or ongoing mental health concern is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, as the accommodation can only be implemented upon receipt of the letter. Visit DSP's [web site](https://dsp.usc.edu/) for more details. For further support, I encourage you to contact USC Support and Advocacy (uscsupport@usc.edu). To maintain fairness and equality for all students, extensions to due dates are only granted in accordance with these official accommodation letters. If you need to request a *one-time emergency* extension to an assignment (e.g., due to a major illness or to a death in the family) you must do the following proactively *prior to its due date*: 1) provide written documentation, such as an official doctor's note, explaining that you are unable to complete the assignment by its due date and 2) work out an extension with the instructor.

## Academic Conduct

Recording a university class is forbidden without the express permission of the instructor and announcement to the class. Recording can inhibit future free discussion and thus infringe on the academic freedom of other students as well as the instructor.

Plagiarism, presenting someone else's ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words, is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, "Behavior Violating University Standards" https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b. Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university policies on scientific misconduct, https://policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct.
